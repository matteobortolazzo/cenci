description: Diagnose and repair failing CI for an existing pull request without reopening the implementation pipeline.

Read `project-core`, `testing`, `shell-rules`, and `subagent-safety`. Diagnose the named
failing jobs, work only in the PR branch worktree, reproduce the root cause locally, make
the smallest test-backed fix, commit, and push normally. Never force-push, change lifecycle
labels, open another PR, or mark an infrastructure/flaky/external failure as repaired. If
the cause is ambiguous, checkpoint evidence and return control to the babysit supervisor
for human input.
