> **Client dispatch**: In Codex, read `codex-runtime` and `refine/codex.md`, execute that native procedure, and do not continue into the Claude procedure below.

> **Interaction rule**: Every question, confirmation, or approval directed at the user — anywhere in this skill, including error recovery — MUST be asked with the `AskUserQuestion` tool. Never ask in plain text. If an instruction says "ask the user" or "confirm", that means `AskUserQuestion`.

## Context

Read `project-core` and resolve neutral configuration before continuing.

Use the config returned by `project-core`; if none exists, stop with its client-appropriate setup guidance.

**Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:**
The first token is the ticket ID. Everything after it is optional **user context** (additional instructions or focus areas).

Split `$ARGUMENTS` into:
- **Ticket ID**: the first whitespace-delimited token, with any leading `#` prefix stripped.
  For example: `#1 focus on API` → ID `1`, `7` → ID `7`.
- **User context**: everything after the first token (may be empty).
  For example: `42 focus on the API layer` → context is `focus on the API layer`.

**Ticket ID validation**: Validate the parsed ticket ID against `^[0-9]+$`. If it does not match, **stop immediately** — do not run `gh`, do not write any temp file — and tell the user:
"The ticket ID must be numeric (digits only) — got `<value>`. Re-run `/cenci:refine <ticket-id> [additional context]` with the ticket's numeric ID (e.g. `/cenci:refine 350`)."

**Shell rules**: Read the `shell-rules` skill before running any `gh` commands (covers heredoc temp-file pattern).

**Fetch the ticket:**
Extract owner/repo from `git remote get-url origin` (e.g. `git@github.com:owner/repo.git` → `owner/repo`).

**owner/repo validation**: Trim surrounding whitespace from the derived value (e.g. a trailing newline from command output), then validate it against `^[A-Za-z0-9._-]+/[A-Za-z0-9._-]+$` (exactly one `/`, each segment limited to letters, digits, `.`, `_`, `-`), additionally rejecting either segment being exactly `.` or `..`, or ending in `.git` (GitHub never allows a repo name to end in `.git`, so a trailing `.git` here always indicates a botched extraction, not a real repo name). If it does not match, **stop immediately** — do not run `gh`, do not write any temp file. Before echoing the value below, redact anything up through the last `@` (keep only the text after it, or the whole value if no `@` is present) so a malformed remote URL with embedded userinfo/credentials is never echoed back — then tell the user:
"The derived `owner/repo` value (`<value>`) does not look like a valid `owner/repo`. Check `git remote get-url origin` and verify the remote URL is correctly configured."

Once validated, run:
```bash
gh issue view <number> --repo <owner>/<repo> --json number,title,body,labels,state,assignees,milestone,comments,author
```
Each entry in `comments` now also carries its own `author.login` and `authorAssociation` — the bundle written in step 4 below passes these through per comment so the refiner's Design Coverage Check can restrict which comments' ticket-carried screen node references count toward coverage.

The ticket's **own** author association needs a second read: `gh issue view --json` exposes no top-level `authorAssociation` field (it exists only per comment, inside `comments`), so requesting it there makes the whole fetch above exit non-zero with `Unknown JSON field: "authorAssociation"`. The REST issue endpoint exposes it as `author_association`:
```bash
gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<number> --jq '.author_association'
```
If this call fails, treat the ticket's own association as unknown — it is then not one of the accepted values, so a ticket-body screen node reference does not count toward coverage. Never substitute a per-comment `authorAssociation` for it.

**Split-child provenance detection:** Determine whether this ticket is itself a child of an earlier split — mirrors `agents/context-gatherer.md`'s parent-child detection. Primary source is the native sub-issue link:
```bash
gh issue view <number> --repo <owner>/<repo> --json parent --jq '.parent.number // empty'
```
If that returns a number, record `isSplitChild: true` and `parentNumber: <that number>`. **Fallback** (older tickets linked only by convention, or the primary command failing non-zero): if the first non-empty line of the fetched body matches `Related to #<number>`, record `isSplitChild: true` with that number as `parentNumber`. If neither yields a parent, record `isSplitChild: false`. A split child is presumed sized by its parent's refinement — split depth is one (`docs/ticket-sizing.md`) — so this flag drives the bundle's resolved flags (step 4), the **Split-depth guard** in step 9, and the **Oversize split child escalation** at the `## Confirmation Gate`.

## Attachments

Read the `attachments` reference skill and follow its 4-step procedure to discover, present, download, and load ticket attachments. If no attachments are found or the user selects none, proceed to Pre-flight Checks.

Store each image summary alongside its file reference for use during refinement.

## Pre-flight Checks

After fetching the ticket, inspect its current state before proceeding:

Check the issue's `labels` array and `state` field.

If any of these conditions are true, warn the user and ask for confirmation using `AskUserQuestion`:

| Condition | Message |
|-----------|---------|
| Ticket is closed/resolved | "This ticket is closed/resolved. Do you still want to refine it?" |
| Has "Refined" label/tag | "This ticket is already marked as Refined. Do you want to re-refine it?" |
| Has "Planned" label/tag | "This ticket already has a saved plan (Planned). Do you want to re-refine it?" |
| Has "Working" label/tag | "This ticket is currently being worked on. Do you want to re-refine it?" |
| Has "In Review" label/tag | "This ticket has an open PR (In Review). Do you want to re-refine it?" |
| Has "Implemented" label/tag | "This ticket is already marked as Implemented (its PR merged). Do you want to re-refine it?" |

If the user says no → stop. If yes → proceed normally.

## Ownership Inspection (read-only)

Read the `ticket-ownership` reference skill's `## Inspect ownership (read-only)`
section only, and follow it using the assignees from the ticket fetch above — this
performs zero GitHub writes. Record the result as `ownershipState`
(`unowned` | `owned-by-caller` | `conflict`) for the `## Confirmation Gate`
manifest below. The claim itself is deferred to the write phase (`## Update Ticket`
below, `#### Ownership claim (first write)`) — it must not run before the gate's
confirmation. Never replace an existing assignee.

## Your Role

You orchestrate backlog refinement. The judgment-heavy analysis — ambiguity hunting, question drafting, sizing, and the refined ticket proposal — is delegated to the **refiner** agent (spawned via the `Task` tool), whose `model: opus` frontmatter pin holds for its entire run; a skill-level pin only lasts the invoking turn, so it would silently degrade every follow-up turn of the Q&A loop to the session model. You run the interaction and the writes: relay the refiner's questions to the user, feed answers back, and perform every GitHub mutation yourself, all of them after the `## Confirmation Gate`. Never perform the refiner's analysis inline, and never delegate a GitHub write or an `AskUserQuestion` to a subagent (see the `subagent-safety` skill).

## Process

1. **Summarize** the fetched ticket for the user in 2-3 lines (title, current scope, state). Do not analyze it — that is the refiner's job.

2. **Classify ticket type**: Read the `frontend-classification` reference skill and apply its rule to determine if this ticket involves frontend/UI work. Record the result as `isFrontend` for the bundle and the labeling steps.

   **Design-only classification** (if `isFrontend` AND `pencil.enabled` is `true` in `.cenci/config.json`): determine whether the ticket's *deliverable* is the design itself — a `.pen` file plus `DESIGN.md` spec, with no production code change (e.g., "Design the settings page", "Create mockups for the onboarding flow"). If the signals point that way, confirm via `AskUserQuestion`:

   > "This reads as a design-only ticket — the deliverable would be a design spec (`.pen` + `DESIGN.md`) produced by `/cenci:design`, with no code change. Is that right?"

   Options: "Yes — design-only", "No — includes implementation"

   If confirmed, set `isDesignTicket = true`. Design-only tickets are routed to `/cenci:design`, not `/cenci:implement`: they skip the browser question (step 8) and the `ui:visual-check` label (step 12), and receive the `Design` label in step 11. The refiner focuses its analysis accordingly via the bundle's `isDesignTicket` flag — design questions (visual direction, screens, states, design-system fit) instead of implementation-only items.

   The **Design Coverage Check** (`.pen`/`DESIGN.md` evaluation and the `designNeeded` determination) is performed by the refiner agent, not here — its result arrives in the proposal's `### Design Coverage` section (step 7); a conventions-only DESIGN.md is not itself a coverage gap, so `designNeeded` only goes true when there is genuinely no design to work from. **Design always happens on a dedicated design ticket, never on the implementation ticket itself** — when `designNeeded` is true, the design ticket is created later, either as the first child of a split (see **Design-first splits** in step 9) or as a companion ticket (see **Companion design ticket** in the Update Ticket section).

3. **Create the per-run temp-file token.** Run `mktemp -u ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/cenci/issue-<number>-XXXXXX` once and capture the trailing random segment as `<token>` (the token is the random suffix only, e.g. `a1b2c3` — not the full mktemp basename). As with `<ticket-id-or-slug>` in the implement phases, carry the literal `<token>` value forward as text into every temp-file path for the rest of this run — do NOT re-derive it per Bash call, and do not use `$$`/shell state (it does not persist across separate Bash tool invocations). `-u` is a dry-run name generator — it only produces a unique-ish suffix, not an atomically-created file — which is why the `Write` tool is what actually creates each temp file in this run. The `<token>` is a **collision-avoidance mechanism only** — it reduces the chance of two concurrent runs picking the same temp-file basename — and is explicitly **not** an atomic reservation (a second run could theoretically generate the same suffix before either run's `Write` call lands) and **not** a security boundary (it provides no protection against a malicious or adversarial process targeting the same path).

4. **Write the context bundle.** Use the `Write` tool to create `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/cenci/issue-<number>-<token>-bundle.md` containing, in order:
   - The **verbatim** ticket title, body, labels, state, and comments from the fetch above — full text, never a digest or paraphrase (the refiner's decisions require source fidelity; see `docs/skill-authoring.md`). Include the ticket's own `author.login` (from `gh issue view`) paired with its `author_association` (from the REST issue-endpoint read) alongside the body, and each comment's `author.login`/`authorAssociation` alongside its body, per the two fetches above.
   - Each attachment's summary alongside its downloaded file path (from the Attachments step).
   - The user context parsed from `$ARGUMENTS`, verbatim (or `None`).
   - The resolved flags: `isFrontend`, `isDesignTicket`, `pencil.enabled`, `pencil.designPath` (from the resolved config), and `isSplitChild` with its `parentNumber` (from the **Split-child provenance detection** in the Context section above; `parentNumber` is omitted when `isSplitChild` is false).

   If the `Write` fails, retry once; if it still fails, STOP and report the error — the refiner must never run without the bundle.

5. **Delegate to the refiner agent** (`Task` tool, agent `refiner`). The first invocation's prompt contains only: the bundle path, a note that this is round 1, and the instruction to read the bundle file in full before analyzing. Later rounds additionally carry the Q&A history (step 6) — do not re-paste ticket or bundle content into any prompt; the bundle path is the context.

6. **Q&A relay loop.** Parse the refiner's `## Questions` section:
   - If it is `None.` → the same output contains the `## Refined Ticket Proposal`; continue to step 7.
   - Otherwise, present the round's questions to the user **in the refiner's order**. Present the round's questions in a single `AskUserQuestion` call — up to 4 questions per call, matching the refiner's per-round cap exactly. Never merge multiple refiner questions into one composite question, and never ask them as plain text. A round can exceed 4 only via the refiner's cap-exempt confirm/overrule question (`agents/refiner.md`'s entailed-decision rule); when it does, split into consecutive `AskUserQuestion` calls of at most 4 questions each, preserving the refiner's order across calls — never drop or defer the extra question. When the refiner supplied answer options for a question, map them onto the `AskUserQuestion` options using the refiner's wording (the user can always answer freeform via "Other"); otherwise offer sensible options. When the refiner marked one option recommended, map it onto the first `AskUserQuestion` option, appending `(Recommended)` to that option's label and carrying the rationale into its description; this is advisory: a question with no marked recommendation is relayed exactly as today and never triggers a re-invocation of the refiner.
   - When every question in the round is answered, re-invoke the refiner with the bundle path and the **complete** accumulated Q&A history — all rounds, as `Q:`/`A:` pairs using the refiner's original question wording; do not re-paste ticket or bundle content. Route the new output through this step again. The refiner asks at most 4 questions per round and rounds continue until it returns `None.`.

7. **Proposal received.** When the refiner returns `None.`, its output contains the `## Refined Ticket Proposal` — the summary content adopted in step 9 and persisted in steps 10-12. Read `designNeeded` from its `### Design Coverage` section (treat it as false when the section or field is absent).

8. **Before adopting the proposal**, ask one final infrastructure question — but only when it can plausibly apply. **Skip for design-only tickets** (`isDesignTicket` is true) — they never reach the implement pipeline; set `browserRequired: false`. Ask it if the ticket was classified frontend/UI in step 2, **or** the ticket/answers mention web scraping, browser automation, or manual browser testing. For pure backend/infrastructure/data tickets with none of those signals, skip the question and set `browserRequired: false`.

   Using `AskUserQuestion`:
   "Does this story need interactive browser access during implementation? (e.g., for visual verification, form testing, or web scraping). If yes, the implementer should ensure `playwright-cli` is installed (`npm i -g @playwright/cli`)."
   - If **yes** → note `browserRequired: true` for the labeling step
   - If **no** → proceed normally

9. **When refined**, adopt the refiner's `## Refined Ticket Proposal` **verbatim** as the summary content — its sections (`### Updated Title` (optional), `### Updated Description`, `### Acceptance Criteria`, `### Assumptions (auto-adopted)`, `### Decisions`, `### Technical Notes`, `### Design Coverage`, `### Design Direction`, `### Automation`, `### Size Estimate`, `### Suggested Split` with `#### Execution Order`) map 1:1 onto the persistence steps below; the section formats themselves are specified in `agents/refiner.md`. `### Assumptions (auto-adopted)` and `### Decisions` persist into the ticket body in step 10, same as `### Acceptance Criteria`; `### Automation` drives the `## Confirmation Gate`'s per-ticket `automerge:ok` verdict computation (parent and every child) and is never written into the body. Do not rewrite, summarize, or reorder the proposal's content. The proposal itself is rendered to the user at the `## Confirmation Gate` below, before any write — it is not held back until the final message; steps 10-13 persist the ticket update, any split or companion design ticket, and the labels only after that gate's Confirm branch (see the **Final Message** note at the end of the Update Ticket section).

   A `### Suggested Split` in the proposal means each child becomes its own numbered ticket and PR, linked to the parent as a native GitHub sub-issue, with dependency ordering captured in the child bodies (Pass 1/Pass 2 below).

   **Split-depth guard (fail closed).** When `isSplitChild` is true and the adopted proposal nonetheless contains a `### Suggested Split`, STOP immediately — render no Confirmation Gate manifest, ask no confirmation, perform zero GitHub writes — and report that the refiner violated the no-resplit contract for split child #`<number>` (child of #`<parentNumber>`; see `agents/refiner.md`'s **Split children are never split again** rule), and that re-running `/cenci:refine <number>` is how to retry. Split depth is one and grandchild tickets are never created (`docs/ticket-sizing.md`); an L-sized split child is handled by the **Oversize split child escalation** at the `## Confirmation Gate` below, never by another split.

   **Design-first splits** (if frontend feature AND `pencil.enabled` is `true` AND `designNeeded` is true): the proposal's split makes the first child a **design-only ticket** (e.g., "Design <feature> screens") that every UI implementation child depends on. It gets the `Design` label in Pass 1, its body includes the `### Design Direction` section from the proposal (that's where `/cenci:design` reads it from), it is executed via `/cenci:design`, and it produces a committed design spec rather than a PR (the one exception to "1 ticket = 1 PR"). When `/cenci:design` completes it, the `Designed` label is propagated to the implementation children that depend on it, satisfying implement's Design gate.

## Confirmation Gate

Placed here — between Process step 9 (the proposal is adopted) and `## Update Ticket` below — this gate performs **zero** GitHub writes; it only classifies, asks, computes, and renders. **No GitHub write of any kind occurs before** its single confirmation — the ownership claim, the `Working` label, and every ticket/label/sub-issue mutation all wait for it. Steps 10-13 below then consume everything this gate computes; they never recompute a verdict or a label set. A split proposal must also clear the Coverage gate precondition immediately below before this gate renders anything.

#### Coverage gate — verify the split's acceptance-criteria partition

Before rendering a manifest for a proposal carrying a `### Suggested Split`, run the structural completeness check first, the acceptance-criteria partition check second — both within this same gate, both gating the same pre-render stop point.

**Structural completeness check.** For every child block in the adopted `### Suggested Split`, verify all six subsections are present: `### Goal`, `### Size`, `### Decisions`, `### Assumptions (auto-adopted)`, `### Acceptance criteria`, and `### Dependencies`. Each present subsection must also satisfy its emptiness rule: `### Goal` must contain non-empty prose — never a placeholder or blank section; `### Size` must contain a real `<S/M> — <reasoning>` value — never empty, and never the "None." sentinel (a split child is always S or M, never L, and always has a real size); `### Dependencies` must be non-empty ("None." is a valid value when the child truly has no dependencies); `### Decisions` and `### Assumptions (auto-adopted)` must each be non-empty or exactly "None."; `### Acceptance criteria` may be empty only for a child the partition assigned zero criteria (e.g. a design-only first child). If any child is missing a subsection or violates its emptiness rule, STOP before any child creation — render no manifest, ask no confirmation, create no tickets, run no Pass 2 — and report the violating child's `(K/N)` title and the missing or empty section(s) so the split can be corrected in another refinement round. This check only confirms presence/absence and does not itself judge whether an empty `### Acceptance criteria` section is legitimate — the acceptance-criteria partition check below is the sole verifier of correct assignment, and a child wrongly left empty will surface there as an unassigned criterion.

**Acceptance-criteria partition check.** Only after the structural completeness check passes for every child, verify the proposal partitions the parent's acceptance criteria per `agents/refiner.md`'s **Acceptance-criteria partition** rule: every `- [ ]` item in the proposal's `### Acceptance Criteria` must appear in exactly one child's `### Acceptance criteria` checklist (scoped rewording is fine as long as the mapping is evident), and no criterion may appear under two children. If any criterion is unassigned or duplicated, STOP — render no manifest, ask no confirmation, create no tickets, run no Pass 2 — and report the violating criteria to the user so the split can be corrected in another refinement round. Nothing has been written at this point, so stopping here is free; proceeding would mint children whose closure can no longer prove the parent's criteria (#661), or, per the structural check above, whose `Refined` label is not truthful (#872).

**Oversize split child escalation (before rendering).** When `isSplitChild` is true and the adopted proposal's `### Size Estimate` is L, surface the refiner's parent re-partition recommendation before rendering the manifest and ask, via `AskUserQuestion`:
   "This ticket is a split child of #`<parentNumber>` and still sizes L (budget risk). Split depth is one, so it will not be split again — proceed with it as-is, or decline so parent #`<parentNumber>`'s partition can be redone?"
   Options: "Proceed — keep the oversize child as-is" / "Decline — redo the parent's partition". **Proceed** ⇒ continue into the numbered steps below with the proposal unchanged (the L reasoning stays in the persisted body's `### Technical Notes`-adjacent sections exactly as the refiner wrote it). **Decline** ⇒ zero GitHub writes have occurred and none will occur — jump to step 13's declined-cleanup branch, and report that re-running `/cenci:refine <parentNumber>` is how to re-partition the parent. Either way this escalation only asks — it never modifies the proposal, and it never splits: this is the human hand-off for an oversize child, replacing any automatic grandchild creation.

1. **Per-child classification** — only when the adopted proposal carries a `### Suggested Split`. For each proposed child K, apply the `frontend-classification` reference skill to **that child's own block text** (its title, `### Goal`, and `### Acceptance criteria`) — never an inlined keyword list; that skill is the single source of truth. Record `childIsFrontend(K)` and `childVisualCheck(K)` (the visual-check signal subset) per child.

2. **Per-child browser question** — for each child where `childIsFrontend(K)` is true, or whose block mentions web scraping, browser automation, or manual browser testing, ask step 8's question once, scoped to that child:
   "Does child (K/N) `<title>` need interactive browser access during implementation? (e.g., for visual verification, form testing, or web scraping). If yes, the implementer should ensure `playwright-cli` is installed (`npm i -g @playwright/cli`)."
   Batch up to 4 children per `AskUserQuestion` call, one question per child, in child order (1/N … N/N); if more than 4 children need the question, split into consecutive calls of at most 4 children each, preserving child order across calls — mirrors step 6's batched-round rule. **Skip entirely for a design-only child** — design children never reach the implement pipeline, exactly as step 8 skips for `isDesignTicket`, and `childBrowserRequired(K)` is set `false`. A child with no frontend/browser signal is not asked at all and gets `childBrowserRequired(K) = false`.

3. **The parent's step-8 question is independent of every child.** Step 8 stays where it is and is unchanged; its answer applies to the parent ticket only and **is never propagated to any child** — on a split the parent is a tracking epic, so a `browserRequired: true` parent answer must not force `Browser` or a withhold onto a child, and a `false` parent answer must not clear a child's own `true`.

4. **Compute effective verdicts**, per ticket T in {parent, child 1…N}:
   `effective grant(T) = ### Automation verdict for T is exactly "grant" AND NOT isDesignTicket AND NOT browserRequired AND NOT visual-check-signals-match` (each override evaluated for T itself — the parent's own `isDesignTicket`/`browserRequired`/visual-check match for the parent; for a child K, `isDesignTicket(K)` is true only when K is the design-only child produced by a Design-first split (the child seeded with `["Refined","Design"]` in Pass 1) — never derived from or equal to `childIsFrontend(K)` — plus that child's own `childBrowserRequired(K)` and `childVisualCheck(K)`).
   **Fail-closed default preserved**: an absent/empty `### Automation` entry for T, or any value other than exactly `grant`, is `withhold`.

5. **Compute the label set per ticket**: the parent's set is computed per steps 11-12 below (unchanged in shape; steps 11-12 consume the gate-computed values rather than recomputing them); each child's set = inherited non-excluded parent labels + `Refined` [+ `Design` for the design child] [+ `Browser` when `childBrowserRequired(K)`] [+ `ui:visual-check` when `childVisualCheck(K)` and the child is not the design child] [+ `automerge:ok` when its effective grant holds]. **Record the gate-time parent snapshot** — the parent's current `labels` and `milestone`, as fetched for this gate — as the basis for "inherited non-excluded parent labels" above; this is a preview, not a promise. It is reconfirmed at write time by `## Update Ticket`'s **Manifest revalidation** sub-step (run before the first write), which re-fetches the parent and diffs it against this gate-time snapshot. That diff is split into two kinds: **authorization-sensitive drift** — a change in `automerge:ok`, `Browser`, or `ui:visual-check` on the parent between the gate and the write — versus **cosmetic drift** — everything else (milestone, `area:*`, priority, team, `Design`, or any other label). The gate's own `automerge:ok`/`Browser`/`ui:visual-check` computation above is authoritative for what this run computed and does not itself change; it is the parent's *current remote state* that may have moved, which is exactly what the revalidation sub-step exists to catch.

6. **Render** the complete adopted proposal, followed by a manifest: one row per ticket to be updated or created, with its title, final label set, its milestone, its intended hierarchy/dependencies (`Related to` / `Depends on` / `Parallel with` lines and native sub-issue links), and `grant`/`withhold` plus a one-line rationale. Include a row for the parent's own pending mutations: the ownership claim (or `already owned by you` when `ownershipState` is `owned-by-caller`) and the `Working` label transition. If the parent already carries sub-issues from a prior run, state in the manifest that those existing children will not be modified — and note that a child created before this gate existed may still carry a legacy `automerge:ok`/`Browser`/`ui:visual-check` grant inherited under the old behavior; this run does not audit or revoke it, since the unmodified child is untouched by design.

7. **One confirmation.** Ask, via `AskUserQuestion`:
   "Apply this refinement as shown?"
   Options: "Confirm — apply as shown" / "Decline — make no changes". No adjust loop — a decline requires a fresh `/cenci:refine <id>` run to change anything.

8. **Decline** ⇒ zero GitHub writes have occurred and none will occur — no ownership claim, no `Working` label, no ticket/label/sub-issue mutation of any kind — so no cleanup mutation is needed: title, body, labels, assignees, milestone, and native sub-issues are state-for-state exactly as they were when this run started. Jump straight to step 13's declined-cleanup branch below, and report that re-running `/cenci:refine <id>` is how to adjust the proposal.

**Confirm** ⇒ continue into `## Update Ticket` below, where steps 10-13 apply every effective verdict and label set exactly as rendered in the manifest.

## Update Ticket

> **CRITICAL**: This section is mandatory after refinement. Do NOT skip it.
> **No GitHub write of any kind occurs before** the human confirms at the `## Confirmation Gate` above — that gate, not the Q&A loop (steps 6-8), is the pre-write authorization boundary. The Q&A loop only shapes the proposal's content; steps 10-13 below execute only after the gate's Confirm branch, and a Decline stops before any of them run (see step 13's declined branch).

> **Write-failure protocol**: Every *edit* in this section (ticket body/title updates, parent tracking updates, label add/remove) MUST be verified by re-fetching the resource with `gh issue view ... --json ...` and confirming the expected change is actually present — a command exiting 0 is not sufficient proof. Ticket *creation* is the one exception: `--jq .number` on the `gh api repos/...` response returns the new issue number directly — a numeric value is the proof; empty output, non-numeric output, or a non-zero exit is a failed create, so no separate re-fetch is required there. A malformed JSON payload surfaces as an API 4xx parse error and is itself a failed write — handle it with the single documented retry below, not a hand-patch loop. This retry also covers the local `Write` tool call that authors the raw title/body files and the `jq -n --rawfile` invocation that composes the JSON payload from them (see the `shell-rules` skill's canonical snippet): if a raw-file `Write` call fails, or the subsequent `jq` invocation exits non-zero, or the payload file is missing/empty/stale when the `gh api repos/... --input` command is about to read it, retry the failed step (`Write` or `jq`) once before (re-)invoking that `gh api repos/...` command — do not assume a local Write or jq failure is instead an API-side rejection. If the write or the verification fails:
> 1. Report the error to the user.
> 2. Retry the write once, then verify again.
> 3. If it still fails, **STOP** — do not proceed to the next step — and emit a partial-state report: what succeeded so far (with concrete issue/label numbers or names), what failed, and what the user needs to do manually to reconcile it. Each write point below states what belongs in that report.

**Per-run temp-file token**: The `<token>` used in every temp-file path of this section is the one created in Process step 3 — carry that same literal value forward; never mint a second token mid-run (two tokens in one run would orphan the earlier files from step 13's cleanup list).

### Write order

The canonical, machine-verified order of every GitHub write this skill performs, reached only via the gate's Confirm branch — nothing before this point ever writes:

1. `claim` — the ownership claim, first write (`#### Ownership claim (first write)` below).
2. `working` — the `Working` label ensure + add (`#### Label "Working"` below).
3. `parent-body` — the parent ticket's title/body update (step 10).
4. `child-create:1` immediately followed by its own `child-link:1`, then `child-create:2` immediately followed by its own `child-link:2`, immediately followed by its own `child-blockers:2` when child 2 has at least one blocking sibling (omitted entirely for a child with none), and so on for every split child in dependency order (Pass 1) — every child's create+link(+blockers) group completes before the next step. The blockers op is per-child optional, and the **first** child never carries one: children are created in dependency order, so child 1 has no already-created sibling to be blocked by. That is why this canonical illustration shows a blockers op on child 2 only — a blockers op on child 1 is not a shape this procedure can produce. (Stated without its op token here on purpose: this section is machine-extracted, and every backtick-quoted token inside it is read as part of the canonical sequence.)
5. `parent-exec-order` — Pass 2's Execution Order note on the parent body when the split has real ordering (step 10 Pass 2(b)); when there is no split, this same slot instead covers the companion design ticket's create, its native `--add-blocked-by` link plus `blockedBy` verification, and the supplementary `Depends on #<D> (design)` prose-line body write.
6. `refined` — step 11's `Refined` label add / `Working` label removal.
7. `visual-check` — step 12's `ui:visual-check` label add (skipped when `isDesignTicket`).

#### Manifest revalidation (read-only — before the first write)

Reached immediately after the gate's Confirm, before the ownership claim, before `Working`, before any other write. Fetch the parent's current milestone and labels **to a file**, as its own Bash call (a fetch failure then surfaces distinctly, before any write), mirroring the same pattern in `implement/phases/phase-9-pr.md`. This fetch is now **unconditional** — it runs on every Confirm, whether or not this run creates split children or a companion design ticket, because it also guards the parent's own label write (steps 11-12) against write-time drift, not only child/design-ticket inheritance. Do not reuse the `labels`/`milestone` already in context from the Context section's fetch or from the gate's own snapshot: both are stale by the time this runs, and externally-sourced label names must never be interpolated into a command line (`docs/skill-authoring.md`) — the file is consumed mechanically by `jq --slurpfile` below, never read back into shell text. The trailing `|| rm -f` is load-bearing: it removes a partially-written file so the presence gate below can never mistake one for a good fetch.
```bash
gh issue view <number> --repo <owner>/<repo> --json milestone,labels > ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/cenci/issue-<number>-<token>-parent-meta.json || rm -f ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/cenci/issue-<number>-<token>-parent-meta.json
```

**Presence gate — fail closed, zero writes (D1).** Read the file back, then validate its content is actually usable — an exit-0 `cat` alone is not proof the fetch produced real data:
```bash
cat ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/cenci/issue-<number>-<token>-parent-meta.json
```
```bash
jq -e 'has("labels")' ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/cenci/issue-<number>-<token>-parent-meta.json > /dev/null
```
If the `cat` command errors (non-zero exit, e.g. `No such file or directory`), OR the file exists but the `jq -e 'has("labels")'` check fails (empty file, malformed JSON, or valid JSON missing the expected `labels` shape) — treat a present-but-empty-or-malformed file exactly the same as a missing one, never as a good fetch — retry the fetch once. If it errors again by either check — the parent cannot be read after one retry — **STOP**: zero writes have occurred anywhere in this run, so stopping here is free (D1; converges with the fail-closed precedent for the identical fetch at `implement/phases/phase-9-pr.md:263` — that fetch's graceful-degrade rationale no longer applies here now that this fetch precedes every write instead of following one). Report that ticket #`<number>`'s metadata could not be fetched and that re-running `/cenci:refine <number>` is how to retry. Do not claim ownership, do not add `Working`, do not update the parent body, do not create children.

**Drift classification — fail closed on authorization-sensitive drift (D2).** If the fetch succeeds, diff the freshly fetched `labels` against the gate-time parent snapshot recorded at step 5 of the `## Confirmation Gate` above:
- **Authorization-sensitive drift** — the parent's `automerge:ok`, `Browser`, or `ui:visual-check` labels changed since the gate rendered its manifest: **STOP** — zero writes anywhere in this run — stop and ask for a fresh confirmation: report exactly what changed and tell the user to re-run `/cenci:refine <number>` from scratch. No in-session re-gate: the gate's single confirmation authorizes exactly the manifest it rendered, and re-rendering here would violate "steps 10-13 never recompute a verdict or a label set."
- **Cosmetic drift** — any other label or milestone change (e.g. `area:*`, priority, team, `Design`, milestone): proceed with the freshly fetched snapshot (not the gate-time one) for every inheritance decision below, and disclose the cosmetic label drift in the **Final Message**.
- **No drift**: proceed with the freshly fetched snapshot as normal.

#### Ownership claim (first write)

The first GitHub write of the run. Read the `ticket-ownership` reference skill's `## Claim ownership (mutating)` section and follow it — re-verify exclusive ownership as the first action after the gate's Confirm, using a fresh fetch: the `ownershipState` recorded in `## Ownership Inspection (read-only)` above may be stale by the time Confirm is reached, since time has passed for the Q&A loop and the gate's questions. If a conflict is found (a different assignee, or multiple assignees since the inspection), **STOP**: a conflict stops here with zero other writes — no `Working`, no parent body edit, no child creation — and report the observed state exactly as `ticket-ownership` specifies. Otherwise the claim proceeds and this run is now the ticket's sole assignee.

#### Label "Working"

Immediately after the ownership claim succeeds, add the "Working" label to signal that the ticket is actively being worked on. `gh issue edit --add-label` fails when the label does not exist in the repository, so ensure it exists first — run each as its own Bash call (`|| true` swallows only the "already exists" error):
```bash
gh label create "Working" --repo <owner>/<repo> --color "FBCA04" --description "Actively being refined, designed, or implemented" 2>/dev/null || true
```
```bash
gh issue edit <number> --repo <owner>/<repo> --add-label "Working"
```
Apply the same ensure-then-add pattern to every label this skill applies later (`Refined`, `Design`, `Browser`, `ui:visual-check`, `automerge:ok`, …): before the first `--add-label <name>` of a label, run its `gh label create <name> … || true` with the color/description from the lifecycle table in `/cenci:configure`.

**Ensure gate-decided labels exist, before Pass 1.** Step 10's Pass 1 below may seed `automerge:ok`, `Browser`, and/or `ui:visual-check` directly into a child's create payload, and step 11 may add `automerge:ok` to the parent — `gh issue edit --add-label` fails when the label does not exist in the repository, so ensure all three exist now, before any child is created (the ensure-then-add rule already exists in `#### Label "Working"` above; this only relocates it ahead of the writes that need it, using the same colors/descriptions as the canonical table at `configure/SKILL.md:715`). Run each ensure as its own Bash call — idempotent (`|| true`), so running one this run doesn't need is harmless:
```bash
gh label create "automerge:ok" --repo <owner>/<repo> --color "006B75" --description "Human granted hands-off merge at refinement — babysit may merge this PR without review" 2>/dev/null || true
```
```bash
gh label create "Browser" --repo <owner>/<repo> --color "BFD4F2" --description "Implementation needs interactive browser access (Playwright CLI)" 2>/dev/null || true
```
```bash
gh label create "ui:visual-check" --repo <owner>/<repo> --color "FEF2C0" --description "Visual/layout change — verify in a browser before merge" 2>/dev/null || true
```

10. **Update the ticket description in the remote system.**

   > **IMPORTANT**: Writing a temp file is NOT updating the ticket. You MUST execute the update command after writing the file. Never stop between writing the temp file and running the update command.

   **When the proposal adopted in step 9 includes an `### Updated Title`**, use the `Write` tool to create the raw title and body as plain text — `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/cenci/issue-<number>-<token>-edit-title.txt` (the updated title) and `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/cenci/issue-<number>-<token>-edit-body.md` (the updated description) — never a hand-escaped JSON literal (the title is free text and must never be interpolated directly into a command line; a title containing `$(…)`, backticks, or quotes would be shell-interpreted). Build the payload per the `shell-rules` skill's canonical `jq -n --rawfile` snippet:
   ```bash
   jq -n --rawfile title ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/cenci/issue-<number>-<token>-edit-title.txt --rawfile body ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/cenci/issue-<number>-<token>-edit-body.md '{title: ($title | rtrimstr("\n")), body: $body}' > ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/cenci/issue-<number>-<token>-edit.json
   ```
   Then run:
   ```bash
   gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<number> -X PATCH --input ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/cenci/issue-<number>-<token>-edit.json
   ```

   Otherwise (no title change), use the `Write` tool to create `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/cenci/issue-<number>-<token>.md` with the `<updated description>` as its content, then run:
   ```bash
   gh issue edit <number> --repo <owner>/<repo> --body-file ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/cenci/issue-<number>-<token>.md
   ```

   `<updated description>` is not description-only: the body file's content is the concatenation of every ticket-body section the proposal carries — `### Updated Description`, `### Acceptance Criteria`, `### Assumptions (auto-adopted)`, `### Decisions`, `### Technical Notes`, `### Size Estimate`, plus `### Design Coverage`/`### Design Direction` when present — in that order; `### Automation` is never included, and neither is `### Suggested Split` itself (its children are persisted as their own separate tickets, never inlined into the parent body).

   **Verify the update succeeded** — re-fetch the ticket and confirm the body (and, when retitled, the title) changed. Compare against a meaningfully wide slice of the body, not just its opening — mid-body corruption from an escaping mistake could otherwise land past a short truncation and go unnoticed:
   ```bash
   gh issue view <number> --repo <owner>/<repo> --json title,body --jq '.title, (.body[:2000])'
   ```

   If the update or verification failed, follow the write-failure protocol: report the error, retry once, and if still failing, STOP — do not create children, do not run Pass 2, do not create the companion design ticket, do not proceed to steps 11-12 — and report to the user that ticket #`<number>`'s description/title update did not persist, so they can retry manually.

   #### Parent metadata for inherited labels/milestone

   Every ticket this skill creates — each split child **and** the companion design ticket — inherits the parent's milestone and its non-lifecycle labels, so a split never drops its children out of the milestone or loses the parent's `area:*`/priority/team labels. The fetch is unconditional now — it already ran, before the first write, in `#### Manifest revalidation (read-only — before the first write)` above, whose presence gate and drift classification already ran too. Reuse that same file here (`${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/cenci/issue-<number>-<token>-parent-meta.json`) — do not re-fetch. That file is consumed mechanically by `ensure-issue.sh init`'s own `--parent-meta`/`--slurpfile` merge (see **Creation Checkpoint** below), never read back into shell text.

   **What is inherited.** When given `--parent-meta <file>`, `ensure-issue.sh init` carries over every label the parent currently has except the 10 lifecycle/transient and per-ticket-grant markers — `"Refined","Working","Planned","In Review","Implemented","Design","Designed","automerge:ok","Browser","ui:visual-check"` — which are per-ticket state or per-ticket grants, never classification. The labels this skill seeds (`Refined`, plus `Design` for a design-only child or the companion design ticket) are applied on top regardless of what is carried over; each child's own earned `automerge:ok`/`Browser`/`ui:visual-check` (computed at the `## Confirmation Gate` above) are appended separately, per child, into that child's manifest entry below — never inherited from the parent's current labels. Two invariants carry over verbatim from phase-9's already-tested form, and are the non-obvious parts — both now enforced inside `ensure-issue.sh` rather than inline here:
   - the milestone must be the numeric `.milestone.number`, not the title — the REST endpoint requires the id;
   - the `milestone` key is resolved via an explicit jq emptiness check, never a bare `//` fallback that would emit `null` (see `docs/shell-scripting-gotchas.md`).

   **`automerge:ok`, `Browser`, and `ui:visual-check` are never inherited.** A split child, the companion design ticket, and (per the followup-creation sites this same ticket also narrows) a followup ticket never inherit a parent's hands-off-merge grant or its browser/visual-check markers — each child's verdict and label set is instead applied explicitly from the gate, independently, into that child's manifest entry (steps 4-5 of the Confirmation Gate above). This closes the leak the old inheritance behavior had: a pre-existing `automerge:ok` already on the parent from a prior run is no longer carried over, because `automerge:ok` is now itself one of the 10 excluded markers.

   If splitting, create the child tickets using a **two-pass approach**:

   Split tickets must also receive the "Refined" label/tag since they were refined during this session — `/cenci:implement` checks for it as a pre-flight condition.

   The **Coverage gate — verify the split's acceptance-criteria partition** already ran, pre-render, as a precondition of the `## Confirmation Gate` above — a split that reaches this point already passed both the structural completeness check and the acceptance-criteria partition check, so Pass 1 below never re-verifies them.

   ## Creation Checkpoint

   Every child and the companion design ticket are created through `scripts/ensure-issue.sh` — a deterministic create/recover/repair/link helper, invoked identically here and in `codex.md` via its four subcommands, `ensure-issue.sh init`, `ensure-issue.sh ensure`, `ensure-issue.sh link`, and `ensure-issue.sh clear` — that makes creation recoverably idempotent across timeouts, retries, crashes, and a resumed `/cenci:refine <id>` session. It never performs a duplicate create: each manifest entry mints a nonce at `init` time and embeds a hidden `<!-- cenci-refine-create:<nonce> -->` marker in the created issue's body, so a resumed run recovers the same issue by re-scanning for that exact marker instead of re-POSTing blind.

   **Before the first POST**, initialize the run's checkpoint:
   ```bash
   bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/refine/scripts/ensure-issue.sh" init --repo <owner>/<repo> --parent <original-number> --checkpoint .plans/.refine-<original-number>.checkpoint.json --manifest ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/cenci/issue-<number>-<token>-manifest.json
   ```
   Add `--parent-meta ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/cenci/issue-<number>-<token>-parent-meta.json` — the file fetched unconditionally, before the first write, in `#### Manifest revalidation (read-only — before the first write)` above; that fetch's presence gate already guarantees the file exists and is valid by the time this step runs, so `--parent-meta` is always passed here, never omitted. The checkpoint lives at `.plans/.refine-<original-number>.checkpoint.json` — keyed by the resource it recovers (this repo and this parent issue), not this run's `<token>`, so a crashed or interrupted run resumes correctly even under a fresh temp-file token on the next attempt (durable recovery state is keyed by the resource it recovers and lives in `.plans/`, never a run-scoped or `/tmp` bookkeeping file — see `docs/pipeline-safety.md`).

   Every later `ensure-issue.sh ensure`/`ensure-issue.sh link` call in Pass 1 and the companion-design block below reads this same checkpoint. If it is missing or corrupt (bad JSON, wrong `schemaVersion`) on any call other than `init`, the script itself exits 11 and does **fail closed** — it never silently re-POSTs. Treat that exit exactly like any other write-failure-protocol STOP: report the error and do not proceed.

   **Once this run completes successfully** (the `.ok` marker in step 12 below is written), clear the checkpoint:
   ```bash
   bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/refine/scripts/ensure-issue.sh" clear --checkpoint .plans/.refine-<original-number>.checkpoint.json
   ```
   `clear` is idempotent — calling it twice is not an error. A run that STOPped partway through steps 10-12 (per the write-failure protocol) **retains** the checkpoint instead: the next `/cenci:refine <original-number>` invocation resumes from it rather than re-creating already-created issues.

   #### Pass 1: Create children with numbered titles and dependency info

   Create children **in dependency order** — independent children first, then children that depend on them (so you have their issue numbers to mark as blockers).

   Each child title gets a `(K/N)` suffix, e.g. "Add API validation (1/3)".

   Each child body includes:
   - `Related to #<parent>` (links back to parent)
   - `Depends on #<sibling>` lines — one per blocking sibling, each on its own line, placed immediately after `Related to #<parent>` and before any `Parallel with #<sibling>` line — a **permanent, human-visible supplement** to the native `--add-blocked-by` link applied after creation (below), never a replacement for it (see the rationale at the blockers step below). A child with no blockers gets no `Depends on` line at all — no empty line, no placeholder.
   - `Parallel with #<sibling>` lines for children it can run alongside (if applicable)
   - Its own `### Acceptance Criteria` section — the criteria the proposal's split assigned to this child (its slice of the parent's partition, verified by the coverage gate above); omit the section only for a child the split assigned zero criteria (e.g. a design-only first child)

   For each child K, use the `Write` tool to create the raw title and body as plain text — `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/cenci/issue-<number>-<token>-child-K-title.txt` (`<ticket-title> (K/N)`) and `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/cenci/issue-<number>-<token>-child-K-body.md` (`Related to #<original-number>\nParallel with #<sibling-number>\n\n<ticket-body>\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] <each criterion the split assigned to this child>`) — never a hand-escaped JSON literal; the title is free text and must never be interpolated directly into the command line. `<ticket-body>` here is that child's **full block** from the proposal's `### Suggested Split` — its `### Goal`, `### Size`, `### Decisions`, and `### Assumptions (auto-adopted)` subsections — so the created ticket is plannable without consulting the parent (AC 5) and carries its own sizing evidence automatically as part of that full-block copy; its own `### Acceptance criteria` and `### Dependencies` subsections are not repeated verbatim here, since the checklist appended by this template (sourced from the coverage-gate-verified partition), the `Parallel with #<sibling-number>` lines above, and the native blocked-by links applied after creation (below) already cover that content. **The template above carries no `Depends on` line, deliberately: for a child with at least one blocking sibling, this initial write omits its `Depends on` line(s) entirely** — the blocking sibling's own issue number is not yet known at this point in Pass 1, so there is nothing to write yet (never a blank placeholder line, and never a bracketed `<blocking-sibling-number>` stand-in, in its place). The line is inserted later, by the deferred body-file re-`Write` immediately below, right before that child's own `ensure-issue.sh ensure` call — that re-`Write` is where a blocked child's `Depends on #<sibling>` lines come from, the only place they are written.

   Design-only children (see **Design-first splits** above) additionally include `"Design"` in that child's seed `labels` array below, and their body includes the `### Design Direction` section from this refinement (that's where `/cenci:design` reads it from).

   Once every child's raw title/body files are written, use the `Write` tool to create a single manifest, `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/cenci/issue-<number>-<token>-manifest.json` — a JSON array with one object per child, in creation order:
   ```
   [{"slot": "child-K-of-N", "titleFile": "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/cenci/issue-<number>-<token>-child-K-title.txt", "bodyFile": "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/cenci/issue-<number>-<token>-child-K-body.md", "labels": ["Refined"], "milestone": null}, …]
   ```
   `labels` is the child's **seed** array only — `["Refined"]`, or `["Refined","Design"]` for a design-only child — extended with each of `automerge:ok`, `Browser`, `ui:visual-check` the child earned at the Confirmation Gate, appended in that fixed order for each label the child earned at the gate — only the ones this child actually earned; never reorder, and never add one the gate did not compute for this child. `milestone` is always `null` in this manifest — the real inherited milestone is merged in by `ensure-issue.sh init`'s `--parent-meta` handling (see **Creation Checkpoint** above, which always passes `--parent-meta` here), not by this manifest. Call `ensure-issue.sh init` once against this manifest (per **Creation Checkpoint**) before creating any child.

   For each child K, in the same dependency order, resolve it to exactly one issue:

   **Deferred body-file write for a blocked child.** If child K has one or more blocking siblings — created earlier in this same dependency-ordered pass, so their issue numbers are already known — re-`Write` `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/cenci/issue-<number>-<token>-child-K-body.md` now, immediately before the `ensure` call below, with the resolved `Depends on #<sibling>` line(s) inserted: one per blocker, each on its own line, immediately after `Related to #<original-number>` and before any `Parallel with #<sibling>` line. A child with no blockers was already written once, above, and is never rewritten. This re-`Write` is safe: `ensure-issue.sh`'s `bodyHash` is recorded at `init` but never read back — `ensure`/repair always compare the live issue body against this file's *current* content, so the resolved-in-place rewrite is exactly what gets created (or repaired to), never silently reverted.
   ```bash
   bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/refine/scripts/ensure-issue.sh" ensure --checkpoint .plans/.refine-<original-number>.checkpoint.json --repo <owner>/<repo> --slot child-K-of-N --title ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/cenci/issue-<number>-<token>-child-K-title.txt --body ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/cenci/issue-<number>-<token>-child-K-body.md
   ```
   `ensure-issue.sh ensure` creates the child only when zero marker-bearing candidates exist for its nonce (`gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues -X POST --input <payload> --jq .number`, payload composed via `jq -n --rawfile`), exactly repairs (`-X PATCH --input`) and reverifies a single drifted match against the manifest, or fails closed on ambiguity — never a duplicate create. Its exit code drives the outcome:
   - **0** — the child now exists (created, or already existed and was verified/repaired); its issue number is in the checkpoint (and in `ensure`'s own `issueNumber=<n>` stdout line). Continue to `link` below.
   - **1** — this create attempt could not be verified (a client-side timeout or a malformed response from the create). Follow the write-failure protocol: report the error, retry `ensure` once more with the exact same arguments (never a new manifest/nonce — the same checkpoint recovers the same slot via marker scan on retry), then if still failing, STOP — do not create any further children, and do not run Pass 2.
   - **10** — multiple marker matches: an unresolvable ambiguity. STOP immediately — do not retry, do not create any further children — and report the partial-state list of candidate issue numbers `ensure` printed, so a human can resolve it manually before re-running `/cenci:refine <original-number>`.
   - **12** — the candidate list itself could not be fetched. Follow the write-failure protocol: report the error, retry once, then if still failing, STOP.
   - **13** — an existing issue for this slot diverged from the manifest and the repair PATCH itself failed. STOP and report the issue number `ensure` printed for manual reconciliation — do not create any further children.
   - **11** — the checkpoint is missing or corrupt. STOP immediately (see **Creation Checkpoint** above) — this should not happen mid-run since `init` already succeeded; do not re-run `init` against a fresh manifest, since that would mint new nonces and orphan any issue already created under the old ones. Report to the user for manual recovery.

   **Verify the title and label set persisted correctly** — `ensure` itself already re-fetched and compared these before returning 0, but re-confirm from this orchestration level too, since a JSON-escaping mistake in the manifest could still mangle a title while parsing successfully:
   ```bash
   gh issue view <child-number> --repo <owner>/<repo> --json title,labels --jq '.title, (.labels[].name)'
   ```
   If the title does not match exactly, or the label set includes a label the gate did not earn for this child or is missing one it did earn, follow the write-failure protocol: report the mismatch and STOP — do not link this child as a sub-issue, do not create any further children, and do not run Pass 2.

   **Link the child as a native sub-issue of the parent**, immediately after `ensure` succeeds for it:
   ```bash
   bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/refine/scripts/ensure-issue.sh" link --checkpoint .plans/.refine-<original-number>.checkpoint.json --repo <owner>/<repo> --slot child-K-of-N --parent <original-number>
   ```
   `ensure-issue.sh link` is idempotent — it checks the parent's existing sub-issue list first, so an already-linked child is a no-op success, never a duplicate `--parent` edit — and verifies from the parent side before returning 0. Exit **14** means the link failed (or could not be verified): follow the write-failure protocol, report the error, retry `link` once, then if still failing, STOP — do not create any further children, and do not run Pass 2. Report the partial state: which children exist (with issue numbers) and which are linked as sub-issues.

   **Mark the child's blockers**, immediately after `link` succeeds for it — one `--add-blocked-by` per sibling this child depends on, using GitHub's native issue-dependency relationship (requires `gh` >= 2.94.0). Creating children in dependency order guarantees every blocker already has a number by the time this runs:
   ```bash
   gh issue edit <child-number> --repo <owner>/<repo> --add-blocked-by <blocking-sibling-number>
   ```
   Several blockers can be applied in one call by repeating the flag, or as a comma-separated list: `--add-blocked-by 200,201`.

   The native link is authoritative for gating — the dispatch gate reads `blockedBy` directly, GitHub renders it as a real blocker in the Relationships sidebar, and it survives any later rewrite of the ticket body. It does **not** replace the child body's own `Depends on #<sibling>` line written above: that line is a **permanent, human-visible supplement**, never a transitional shim. `mergeDependencies` (`watch/internal/dispatch/nativedeps.go`) unions the native and prose sources with native state winning on any collision, and `resolveProse` runs only for numbers not already covered natively — so a prose line duplicating an already-applied native link costs zero additional `gh` calls and zero dependency-resolution budget. Sibling children are always in the same repo, which is what native dependencies support.

   **Verify** each child's blocker set after applying it:
   ```bash
   gh issue view <child-number> --repo <owner>/<repo> --json blockedBy --jq '.blockedBy.nodes[].number'
   ```
   If the edit or verification fails, follow the write-failure protocol: report the error, retry once, then if still failing, STOP — do not create any further children, and do not run Pass 2. Report which children exist, which are linked as sub-issues, and which blocker links were applied.

   Skip this step entirely for a child with no dependencies (e.g. the first child typically has none), and omit `Parallel with` lines that don't apply. A design-only first child is a real child of the parent → link it as a sub-issue exactly like the others.

   #### Pass 2: Final sub-issue verification and (if ordered) an Execution Order note

   The native sub-issue list now renders the child enumeration and progress in the GitHub UI, so **do NOT append a child-ticket markdown checklist** to the parent body — there is no per-child checkbox list to write back.

   **(a) Final verification.** After all children are created and linked in Pass 1, re-fetch the parent's sub-issue list one last time and confirm **every** child number appears in `subIssues.nodes`:
   ```bash
   gh issue view <original-number> --repo <owner>/<repo> --json subIssues,subIssuesSummary --jq '.subIssues.nodes[].number, .subIssuesSummary'
   ```
   If any child is missing from the list, follow the write-failure protocol: report which child is not linked, retry that child's `ensure-issue.sh link --checkpoint .plans/.refine-<original-number>.checkpoint.json --repo <owner>/<repo> --slot <its-slot> --parent <original-number>` once, then verify again; if still failing, STOP and report that children #`<c1>`, #`<c2>`, … exist but child #`<cN>` is not linked as a sub-issue of parent #`<original-number>`, so the user can link it manually with `gh issue edit <cN> --parent <original-number>`.

   **(b) Execution Order (only when the split has real ordering).** If any child `Depends on` another (i.e. the children are not all independent), append a concise **prose** `### Execution Order` section to the parent body — never a `- [ ]` checklist. Use the `Write` tool to create `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/cenci/issue-<original-number>-<token>.md` with the following content (this uses `<original-number>` — parent == original — with the SAME run token from step 10, not a new one):
   ```
   <existing-body>

   ### Execution Order
   #10 first → then #11 and #12 in parallel
   ```
   Then run:
   ```bash
   gh issue edit <original-number> --repo <owner>/<repo> --body-file ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/cenci/issue-<original-number>-<token>.md
   ```
   **Verify** by re-fetching the parent and confirming the `### Execution Order` section is present in the body:
   ```bash
   gh issue view <original-number> --repo <owner>/<repo> --json body --jq '.body'
   ```
   If the split has no ordering (all children independent), skip (b) entirely — the sub-issue list alone conveys the enumeration.

   If the Execution Order update or its verification fails, follow the write-failure protocol: report the error, retry once, and if still failing, STOP and report that children #`<c1>`, #`<c2>`, … are linked as sub-issues of parent #`<original-number>` but the `### Execution Order` note did not persist, so the user can append it manually.

   #### Companion design ticket (frontend tickets, no split)

   If `designNeeded` is true, the ticket is **not** being split, and `isDesignTicket` is false, create a dedicated design ticket — design never runs on the implementation ticket itself:

   Use the `Write` tool to create the raw title and body as plain text — `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/cenci/issue-<number>-<token>-design-title.txt` (`Design: <feature title>`) and `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/cenci/issue-<number>-<token>-design-body.md` (`Related to #<number>\nBlocks #<number>\n\n### Goal\nProduce the design spec (`.pen` + `DESIGN.md`) for #<number> via `/cenci:design`.\n\n### Design Direction\n<the Design Direction section from this refinement>`) — never a hand-escaped JSON literal; the title is free text and must never be interpolated directly into the command line.

   Then use the `Write` tool to create a single-entry manifest, `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/cenci/issue-<number>-<token>-design-manifest.json`:
   ```
   [{"slot": "design", "titleFile": "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/cenci/issue-<number>-<token>-design-title.txt", "bodyFile": "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/cenci/issue-<number>-<token>-design-body.md", "labels": ["Refined","Design"], "milestone": null}]
   ```
   — the companion design ticket inherits exactly like a split child (see **Creation Checkpoint**/**Parent metadata for inherited labels/milestone** above), with `["Refined","Design"]` as its seed array, and — same 10-entry exclusion set as Pass 1 above — never `automerge:ok`, `Browser`, or `ui:visual-check`: a design ticket never receives `automerge:ok` (it always fails the `NOT isDesignTicket` override), and never receives `Browser`/`ui:visual-check` either (steps 2 and 12's design skip apply here too). `milestone` stays `null` in this manifest for the same reason as Pass 1's: real inheritance is merged in by `ensure-issue.sh init`'s `--parent-meta` handling, not by this manifest.

   ```bash
   bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/refine/scripts/ensure-issue.sh" init --repo <owner>/<repo> --parent <number> --checkpoint .plans/.refine-<number>.checkpoint.json --manifest ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/cenci/issue-<number>-<token>-design-manifest.json
   ```
   Add `--parent-meta ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/cenci/issue-<number>-<token>-parent-meta.json` — the file fetched unconditionally, before the first write, in `#### Manifest revalidation (read-only — before the first write)` above; that fetch's presence gate already guarantees the file exists and is valid by the time this step runs, so `--parent-meta` is always passed here, never omitted — exactly as **Creation Checkpoint** above.
   ```bash
   bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/refine/scripts/ensure-issue.sh" ensure --checkpoint .plans/.refine-<number>.checkpoint.json --repo <owner>/<repo> --slot design --title ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/cenci/issue-<number>-<token>-design-title.txt --body ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/cenci/issue-<number>-<token>-design-body.md
   ```

   `ensure-issue.sh ensure`'s exit codes drive the outcome exactly as documented in Pass 1 above — 0 success with the design ticket's number `<D>` in the checkpoint (and in `ensure`'s own `issueNumber=<n>` stdout line); 1/10/11/12/13 each their own retry-or-STOP per the write-failure protocol. **Verify the title and label set persisted correctly** — `ensure` already re-fetched and compared these before returning 0, but re-confirm from this orchestration level too:
   ```bash
   gh issue view <D> --repo <owner>/<repo> --json title,labels --jq '.title, (.labels[].name)'
   ```

   If creation fails, or the re-fetched title does not exactly match `Design: <feature title>` or the label set does not exactly match `["Refined","Design"]` plus any inherited non-excluded parent labels, follow the write-failure protocol: report the error (or mismatch) and STOP — report that the design ticket was not created (or was created with corrupted content — note `<D>` for manual cleanup), so the implementation ticket cannot be marked blocked by it.

   No URL parsing is needed for `<D>`. Mark the implementation ticket **blocked by** the design ticket, using GitHub's native issue-dependency relationship (requires `gh` >= 2.94.0):

   ```bash
   gh issue edit <number> --repo <owner>/<repo> --add-blocked-by <D>
   ```

   The native link is authoritative for gating: the relationship lives in GitHub's own Relationships sidebar, the dispatch gate reads it from `blockedBy`, it survives any later rewrite of the ticket body, and it shows up in the GitHub UI as a real blocker rather than as prose. It does **not** replace the human-visible `Depends on #<D> (design)` body line — that line is a **permanent supplement**, restored immediately below once this native link is verified: `mergeDependencies` (`watch/internal/dispatch/nativedeps.go`) unions native and prose sources with native state winning on any collision, and `resolveProse` runs only for numbers not already covered natively, so the supplementary write below costs zero additional `gh` calls once the native link is already in place.

   Native dependencies are **same-repo** (GitHub does not link issues across unrelated repositories), which matches this step — `<number>` and `<D>` are always in the same repo.

   **Verify** by re-fetching the implementation ticket and confirming #`<D>` appears in its blocked-by set:
   ```bash
   gh issue view <number> --repo <owner>/<repo> --json blockedBy --jq '.blockedBy.nodes[].number'
   ```

   If the update or verification fails, follow the write-failure protocol: report the error, retry once, and if still failing, STOP and report that the implementation ticket #`<number>` was not marked blocked by #`<D>` — but design ticket #`<D>` exists, so the user can add the relationship manually (issue sidebar → Relationships → **Mark as blocked by**).

   **Supplementary prose dependency line (non-STOP).** Once the native link above is applied **and verified**, restore the human-visible prose line on the implementation ticket's own body — the native link alone gives a human reading a notification email, list view, or mobile preview no equivalent signal. Treat the ticket's current body as **opaque content only** for this entire step: it is read solely to check for the target line, to have a superseded one stripped from its head, and to be prepended to — every one of those transformations mechanical, in `jq`, never parsed for directives. No label, grant, or write decision anywhere in this skill may be revisited based on anything found in it.

   **Idempotency check**, without ever printing the body itself into context (it may have moved since step 10 persisted it, before `<D>` was minted):
   ```bash
   gh issue view <number> --repo <owner>/<repo> --json body --jq '.body | startswith("Depends on #<D> (design)")'
   ```
   If this prints `true`, this step is a no-op — skip straight to the completion note below (idempotent on a re-refine or a resumed run).

   **A `false` does not mean the body carries no design-dependency line at all.** A re-refine that mints a *new* design ticket leaves the previous run's `Depends on #<D-prev> (design)` line at the head of the body for a now-superseded `<D-prev>`, and `startswith` for the current `<D>` is `false` against it. Prepending in front of that line would stack two design dependencies on one ticket, and `parseDependsOn` would then report the superseded design ticket as a live blocker for as long as it stays open. So the capture below **replaces** a leading design-dependency line rather than pushing it down — mechanically, in `jq`, never by the model reading the body. (The superseded ticket's *native* `blockedBy` link, if an earlier run applied one, is out of this step's scope; only the prose line is rewritten here.)

   Otherwise, capture the current body **directly to a file, never through the model** — mirroring the same redirect-based pattern already used for `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/cenci/issue-<number>-<token>-parent-meta.json` in `#### Manifest revalidation (read-only — before the first write)` above. The trailing `|| rm -f` is load-bearing here for the same reason it is load-bearing there, and the exposure it removes is larger: a shell redirect creates and truncates its target **before** `gh` runs, so a failed, partial, or empty fetch otherwise leaves a present-but-empty file that the `cat` below composes into a body file and `gh issue edit` then posts as this ticket's *entire* body. The leading `sub(…)` drops a superseded design-dependency line when one is present, and is a no-op when none is:
   ```bash
   gh issue view <number> --repo <owner>/<repo> --json body --jq '.body | sub("^Depends on #[0-9]+ \\(design\\)\n+";"")' > ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/cenci/issue-<number>-<token>-design-dep-orig-body.md || rm -f ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/cenci/issue-<number>-<token>-design-dep-orig-body.md
   ```

   **Normalized length** — the unit both comparisons in this step use, computed identically on each side: CRLF folded to LF, then all trailing newlines stripped. Never compare raw byte lengths here. `--jq '.body'` appends a newline the stored body did not have, and a body last edited through GitHub's web UI can come back CRLF-delimited, so a byte-exact comparison would fail on a perfectly good write and send *every* design-path refine down the verification-failure branch below. `ensure-issue.sh` trims for the same reason (its `rtrimstr("\n")` calls at the create-payload and divergence-check sites); this step folds CRLF as well because, unlike those, it compares against a body it did not author.

   **Capture gate — fail closed into the skip branch below, zero body writes.** An exit-0 redirect is not proof the fetch produced the real body, and the post-edit verification cannot catch a bad capture on its own: it compares the remote against the very file the capture produced, so a truncated capture verifies *clean* while the ticket's body is destroyed. Validate the captured file against the live body **before** composing anything from it. Do not `cat` the file — that would print the body into context, which this step forbids; compare normalized lengths instead:
   ```bash
   gh issue view <number> --repo <owner>/<repo> --json body --jq '.body | sub("^Depends on #[0-9]+ \\(design\\)\n+";"") | gsub("\r\n";"\n") | sub("\n+$";"") | length'
   ```
   ```bash
   jq -n --rawfile body ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/cenci/issue-<number>-<token>-design-dep-orig-body.md '$body | gsub("\r\n";"\n") | sub("\n+$";"") | length'
   ```
   The gate passes only when both commands exit 0 **and** print the same value **and** that value is greater than 0 — carry it forward as `<captured-length>`. A missing file (the `|| rm -f` fired) makes the second command exit non-zero; a truncated or empty fetch makes the two values differ or makes the value 0. Step 10 above already persisted this ticket's full description, so a zero-length body here is never legitimate. If the gate fails, take the first failure branch below: nothing is composed, no `gh issue edit` runs, and the body stays exactly as step 10 left it.

   Use the `Write` tool to create `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/cenci/issue-<number>-<token>-design-dep-prefix.md` containing only `Depends on #<D> (design)` followed by a blank line — **never the full body**; the body content stays entirely in the redirected file above and is never reproduced/re-typed by the model. Concatenate the two mechanically into the file that is actually posted:
   ```bash
   cat ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/cenci/issue-<number>-<token>-design-dep-prefix.md ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/cenci/issue-<number>-<token>-design-dep-orig-body.md > ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/cenci/issue-<number>-<token>-design-dep-body.md
   ```
   Compute the composed file's normalized length **now, before the edit** — it is the value the post-edit verification compares against, and computing it first also catches a `cat` that failed or produced an empty/short file while the body is still untouched:
   ```bash
   jq -n --rawfile body ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/cenci/issue-<number>-<token>-design-dep-body.md '$body | gsub("\r\n";"\n") | sub("\n+$";"") | length'
   ```
   A non-zero exit, or a value not greater than `<captured-length>` (the composed file gained a prefix, so it must be longer than what it was composed from), is the first failure branch below — do not run the edit. Otherwise carry the printed value forward as `<expected-length>`.

   Then run:
   ```bash
   gh issue edit <number> --repo <owner>/<repo> --body-file ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/cenci/issue-<number>-<token>-design-dep-body.md
   ```
   **Verify the full body landed correctly, not merely a prefix** — a short prefix check alone would never catch mid-body or tail corruption from a truncated or malformed write. Confirm both the leading line AND that nothing was dropped or duplicated, again without printing the body itself into context:
   ```bash
   gh issue view <number> --repo <owner>/<repo> --json body --jq '.body | gsub("\r\n";"\n") | startswith("Depends on #<D> (design)\n\n")'
   ```
   ```bash
   gh issue view <number> --repo <owner>/<repo> --json body --jq '.body | gsub("\r\n";"\n") | sub("\n+$";"") | length'
   ```
   Verification passes only when the first command prints `true` **and** the second prints exactly `<expected-length>` — the composed file's normalized length, computed before the edit above. A shorter or longer remote body means the write dropped or duplicated content that a prefix-only check would have missed.

   **This is the skill's only non-STOP write outcome — it takes precedence over `## Update Ticket`'s section-wide write-failure protocol, and deliberately so:** by the time this step's `gh issue edit` runs, the authoritative native `--add-blocked-by` link is already applied and verified, so the dependency is already correctly gated. The two ways this step can still fail are handled differently, since they carry different risk:
   - **If anything at or before the `gh issue edit` fails** — the initial idempotency re-fetch, the body capture, the **capture gate**, the prefix `Write`, the `cat`, the composed-length check, or the `gh issue edit` call itself — the body was never touched, so it is safe to skip. The capture gate is what makes that claim true rather than merely hopeful: a fetch that failed or came back short is rejected *before* anything is composed from it and before any edit runs, so a bad capture can never reach the ticket. Retry once from the idempotency check; if it still fails, do **not** STOP — continue into step 11, and carry a warning into the `### Final Message` below noting that ticket #`<number>`'s human-visible `Depends on #<D> (design)` prose line could not be persisted (the native link is in place and gating correctly) and that the user can add the line manually.
   - **If the `gh issue edit` call succeeds but verification then fails** — the body *was* replaced, but its post-edit content could not be confirmed to match what was intended, a real corruption risk rather than a cosmetic one — retry **once**, and pick the retry by re-running the idempotency check first. Never recompose blind: the prefix may already be in place, and a second prepend would write `Depends on #<D> (design)` twice while passing every check the retry then runs (the prefix check is `true` either way, and the length check would compare the doubled body against a doubled composed file).
     - **Idempotency check prints `false`** — the edit did not land at the head, so a recompose cannot duplicate anything: recompose and re-edit once — re-capture *through the capture gate*, re-`Write` the prefix, re-`cat`, re-compute `<expected-length>`, re-`gh issue edit` — then re-verify.
     - **Idempotency check prints `true`** — the prefix is already there and re-editing would duplicate it: do **not** re-edit. Re-run the verification's two commands once instead; the mismatch may have been a read against a body mid-write. If they now agree, the step succeeded.

     If verification still fails after that single retry, do **not** STOP — continue into step 11, but carry a **distinct** warning into the `### Final Message` below that does not use the reassuring "gating correctly, cosmetic" framing, since the body content itself may now be unexpected: "ticket #`<number>`'s body was edited but the post-edit content could not be verified — please check the ticket body directly."

   When `/cenci:design <D>` completes, it closes #<D> and propagates the `Designed` label to this ticket, satisfying implement's Design gate.

11. **Add the "Refined" label and remove "Working":**

   **Use the effective `automerge:ok` grant for the parent computed at the `## Confirmation Gate` above (step 4) — do not recompute it here.** That computation already ANDed the refiner's `### Automation` verdict for the parent with the three skill-local safety overrides (`isDesignTicket` from step 2, `browserRequired` from step 8, and the **visual-check signals** match from the `frontend-classification` reference skill — the same signal set step 12 below writes) and applied the fail-closed default (an absent/empty `### Automation` entry, or any value other than exactly `grant`, is `withhold`). Steps 11-12 consume that already-computed value; they never re-derive it.

   The `automerge:ok` label was already ensured to exist before Pass 1 above.

   - If `isDesignTicket` is true:
     `gh issue edit <number> --repo <owner>/<repo> --add-label "Refined" --add-label "Design" --remove-label "Working"`
   - Else if `browserRequired` is true:
     `gh issue edit <number> --repo <owner>/<repo> --add-label "Refined" --add-label "Browser" --remove-label "Working"`
   - Otherwise:
     `gh issue edit <number> --repo <owner>/<repo> --add-label "Refined" --remove-label "Working"`
   - If re-refining and `browserRequired` is false but the issue currently has the `Browser` label, also add `--remove-label "Browser"`
   - If re-refining and `isDesignTicket` is false but the issue currently has the `Design` label, also add `--remove-label "Design"`
   - Append to whichever branch's command ran, orthogonally to the labels above: if the effective grant holds, append `--add-label "automerge:ok"`; otherwise, if the issue currently carries `automerge:ok` (re-refine withdrawing a prior grant), append `--remove-label "automerge:ok"`; otherwise append nothing.

   **Verify** by re-fetching the issue's labels and confirming the expected set — including `automerge:ok`'s presence or absence — is present/absent:
   ```bash
   gh issue view <number> --repo <owner>/<repo> --json labels --jq '.labels[].name'
   ```

   If the edit or verification fails, follow the write-failure protocol: report the error, retry once, and if still failing, STOP and report which labels did and didn't apply on ticket #`<number>`.

12. **Write `ui:visual-check` for the parent** (skip if `isDesignTicket` is true): **use the parent's visual-check-signals-match result computed at the Confirmation Gate above (step 4) — evaluation already happened there; this step only performs the write.** If it matched, add the label:
   `gh issue edit <number> --repo <owner>/<repo> --add-label "ui:visual-check"`

   **Verify** by re-fetching the issue's labels and confirming `ui:visual-check` is present:
   ```bash
   gh issue view <number> --repo <owner>/<repo> --json labels --jq '.labels[].name'
   ```

   If the edit or verification fails, follow the write-failure protocol: report the error, retry once, and if still failing, STOP and report that `ui:visual-check` did not apply to ticket #`<number>`.

   This label signals to the implement skill that interactive browser verification via Playwright CLI should be used.

   **Mark this run complete.** Once step 12 has taken its action or been correctly skipped (`isDesignTicket` is true), and the write-failure protocol has not STOPped anywhere in steps 10-12, use the `Write` tool to create an empty file at `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/cenci/issue-<number>-<token>.ok`. This marker is what step 13 checks before deleting anything. Confirm the write succeeded by re-reading it with `cat ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/cenci/issue-<number>-<token>.ok` — if that `cat` errors, treat the marker write itself as failed (report it as such, distinct from a steps-10-12 failure) rather than letting step 13 silently read it as "absent" for an unrelated reason.

13. **Clean up this run's scoped temp files.**

   This step is reached from two distinct places: **the declined branch** (step 8 of the Confirmation Gate above, when the human chose Decline — steps 10-12 never ran at all) and **the normal post-write path** (after steps 10-12 ran, whether they all succeeded or one of them STOPped per the write-failure protocol). Handle the declined branch first, separately — it is not the same case as "marker absent" below even though both leave the `.ok` marker unwritten.

   **Declined branch.** Reached only from the gate's Decline option. The `.ok` marker is **intentionally absent** here — steps 10-12 never ran, so there is nothing to verify and no write to prove — which is different from the marker-absent case below, where steps 10-12 *did* run and one of them failed. Delete only the file this run wrote before the gate (the bundle; nothing else exists yet at decline time):
   ```bash
   rm -f ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/cenci/issue-<number>-<token>-bundle.md
   ```
   Report plainly that zero GitHub writes occurred (per the gate's step 8 — title, body, labels, assignees, milestone, and native sub-issues are state-for-state unchanged) and that re-running `/cenci:refine <number>` is how to adjust the proposal. Skip the rest of this step — do not check the `.ok` marker file, it was never expected to exist.

   For a Confirm run, check whether this run completed successfully by attempting to read the marker file:
   ```bash
   cat ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/cenci/issue-<number>-<token>.ok
   ```
   If the command errors (non-zero exit, e.g. `No such file or directory`), the marker is absent. If it exits 0 (silently, since the marker is an empty file), the marker is present.

   **If the marker is present** — every write in steps 10-12 succeeded and was verified. First, clear this run's creation checkpoint (success path only — see **Creation Checkpoint** above; `clear` is idempotent, so it is harmless even when this run created neither split children nor a companion design ticket and no checkpoint was ever initialized):
   ```bash
   bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/refine/scripts/ensure-issue.sh" clear --checkpoint .plans/.refine-<original-number>.checkpoint.json
   ```
   Then it's safe to delete this run's temp files by explicit path (never a glob — an unmatched glob errors under some shells, and `rm -f` already ignores paths that don't exist, so listing files a given run didn't create — e.g. child/design files when there was no split or companion design ticket — is harmless). Note `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/cenci/issue-<number>-<token>-parent-meta.json` is deliberately absent from this list — `ensure-issue.sh init` already consumed and removed it itself, when it was passed:
   ```bash
   rm -f ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/cenci/issue-<number>-<token>.md ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/cenci/issue-<number>-<token>-bundle.md ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/cenci/issue-<number>-<token>-edit.json ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/cenci/issue-<number>-<token>-edit-title.txt ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/cenci/issue-<number>-<token>-edit-body.md ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/cenci/issue-<number>-<token>-manifest.json ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/cenci/issue-<number>-<token>-design-manifest.json ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/cenci/issue-<number>-<token>-design-title.txt ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/cenci/issue-<number>-<token>-design-body.md ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/cenci/issue-<number>-<token>-design-dep-orig-body.md ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/cenci/issue-<number>-<token>-design-dep-prefix.md ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/cenci/issue-<number>-<token>-design-dep-body.md ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/cenci/issue-<number>-<token>-child-K-title.txt ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/cenci/issue-<number>-<token>-child-K-body.md ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/cenci/issue-<number>-<token>.ok
   ```
   Repeat the child-K paths (with the actual `K` value substituted) for each child created in Pass 1 this run.

   **If the marker is absent (and this is not the declined branch above)** — an earlier step in 10-12 did not complete successfully (the write-failure protocol already STOPped before reaching this step). Skip cleanup entirely, including the checkpoint clear above, and state explicitly to the user that cleanup was skipped for this reason: the run's `<token>`-scoped temp files are preserved for manual recovery, and the creation checkpoint (if one was initialized) is deliberately **retained** so the next `/cenci:refine <original-number>` invocation can resume from it instead of re-creating already-created issues.

### Final Message

The complete adopted proposal was already rendered once, at the `## Confirmation Gate` above, before any write — do not re-print it here. After steps 10-13 complete, present only a persistence notice plus a per-ticket verdict summary confirming that what was applied matches what was confirmed:

> Ticket #`<n>` updated. Labels: Refined[, Design][, Browser][, ui:visual-check][, automerge:ok]. [Created `N` child tickets: #`<c1>` (automerge: grant|withhold)[, #`<c2>` (automerge: grant|withhold)…].] [Created companion design ticket #`<D>`.] [Note: cosmetic label drift was detected on the parent between the gate and the write — <what changed>; every applied label and grant/withhold decision above still matches what you confirmed, since only non-authorization-sensitive labels moved.] [Warning: ticket #`<number>`'s human-visible `Depends on #<D> (design)` prose line could not be persisted after one retry — the native blocked-by link is in place and gating correctly; add the line manually.] [Warning: ticket #`<number>`'s body was edited but the post-edit content could not be verified — please check the ticket body directly.]
>
> Every applied label and grant/withhold decision matches what you confirmed at the gate above.

Do not name or suggest the next command to run (`/cenci:implement`, `/cenci:design`, etc.) here — that's covered by the **After Refinement** section below.

## After Refinement

**STOP HERE.** Your job is done. Do not:
- Enter plan mode or propose an implementation plan
- Offer to run `/cenci:implement` or start implementation
- Suggest next steps beyond what's described above

The user will explicitly invoke `/cenci:implement` when they're ready to proceed — or `/cenci:design` for design-only tickets (labeled `Design`).
